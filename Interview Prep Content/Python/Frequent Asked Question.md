## 🔹 Basic Level

**1. What are the key features of Python?**  
👉 _“Python is an interpreted, high-level, and dynamically typed language. It’s object-oriented, easy to learn, and comes with a huge standard library, which makes it popular for web development, data science, automation, and AI.”_

**2. What are Python’s built-in data types?**  
👉 _“Python supports different data types like numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and booleans. It also has binary types like bytes and memory views.”_

**3. Difference between list, tuple, set, and dictionary?**  
👉 _“Lists are ordered and mutable. Tuples are ordered but immutable. Sets are unordered and only store unique values. Dictionaries store key-value pairs where keys are unique.”_

**4. What are mutable and immutable types in Python?**  
👉 _“Mutable types like lists and dictionaries can be changed after creation. Immutable types like strings, tuples, and numbers cannot be modified once created.”_

**5. Difference between `is` and `==`?**  
👉 _“`==` checks for value equality, while `is` checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory.”_

**6. What are namespaces and scopes in Python?**  
👉 _“A namespace is a container for names. Scope defines the visibility of these names, and Python follows the LEGB rule: Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in.”_

**7. What is PEP 8 and why is it important?**  
👉 _“PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python. It improves code readability and ensures consistency across projects.”_

**8. How does Python handle memory management?**  
👉 _“Python manages memory using private heap space, reference counting, and garbage collection for unused objects.”_

**9. What are modules and packages?**  
👉 _“A module is a single Python file, while a package is a collection of modules organized in a directory with an `__init__.py` file.”_

**10. Difference between Python 2 and 3?**  
👉 _“Python 2 is legacy and no longer supported, while Python 3 is the present and future. Python 3 uses Unicode by default and has cleaner syntax like `print()` as a function.”_

## 🔹 Intermediate Level

**11. What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?**  
👉 _“The GIL is a mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. It makes multi-threading less effective for CPU-bound tasks.”_

**12. Difference between shallow copy and deep copy?**  
👉 _“A shallow copy copies only the object but references nested objects. A deep copy copies everything recursively, creating fully independent objects.”_

**13. What are `*args` and `**kwargs` used for?**  
👉 _“`*args` lets us pass multiple positional arguments, while `**kwargs` allows multiple keyword arguments.”_

**14. What are Python decorators?**  
👉 _“Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods without changing their source code.”_

**15. What are generators and iterators in Python?**  
👉 _“An iterator is an object with `__iter__` and `__next__` methods. A generator is a special type of iterator created with `yield` that produces values lazily.”_

**16. Difference between class method, static method, and instance method?**  
👉 _“Instance methods work with object data, class methods work with class-level data, and static methods are independent of both class and instance.”_

**17. What are Python’s built-in data structures?**  
👉 _“Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries are Python’s main built-in data structures.”_

**18. What are metaclasses?**  
👉 _“Metaclasses are classes of classes. They define how classes behave and can control class creation.”_

**19. Difference between Python arrays and NumPy arrays?**  
👉 _“Python arrays or lists are flexible but slower. NumPy arrays are optimized, fixed-type, and much faster for numerical operations.”_

**20. How does Python handle exceptions?**  
👉 _“Python uses try-except blocks to handle exceptions. It can also use `finally` for cleanup and `else` for code that runs if no error occurs.”_

## 🔹 Advanced Level

**21. How does Python manage memory?**  
👉 _“Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free up unused memory. It also has memory pools for efficiency.”_

**22. What is garbage collection in Python?**  
👉 _“Garbage collection automatically deletes objects that are no longer referenced, freeing up memory.”_

**23. What is monkey patching?**  
👉 _“Monkey patching means changing a class or module at runtime. It’s powerful but can make code harder to maintain.”_

**24. What is the difference between `@property` and getter/setter methods?**  
👉 _“`@property` allows attribute access with method control, while traditional getters and setters require explicit method calls.”_

**25. What are common data serialization formats in Python?**  
👉 _“Python supports JSON, Pickle, Marshal, YAML, and CSV for data serialization.”_

**26. What is the `with` statement in Python?**  
👉 _“The `with` statement is used for resource management. It ensures resources like files are closed automatically after use.”_

**27. Difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?**  
👉 _“Synchronous execution runs tasks one after another. Asynchronous execution allows tasks to pause and let others run, improving performance for I/O-bound operations.”_

**28. Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**  
👉 _“Multithreading uses multiple threads in one process but is limited by the GIL. Multiprocessing uses separate processes, allowing true parallelism.”_

**29. Difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`?**  
👉 _“`__str__` gives a user-friendly string, while `__repr__` gives a detailed developer-friendly representation.”_

**30. What are Python’s common use cases?**  
👉 _“Python is widely used in web development, automation, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cloud, and scripting.”_
