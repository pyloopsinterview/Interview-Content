# Interview Preparation - Murali Mohan

## 1. Tell me about yourself
Hi, my name is **Murali Mohan**. I have over **12 years of experience** as a Lead Python Developer, with a focus on backend engineering, API integrations, and full-stack development. 
Currently, I work at **Bon Secours Mercy Health**, leading a team of six developers. We build scalable healthcare applications that improve patient engagement and streamline care. 
My role involves designing RESTful APIs, integrating third-party systems, developing microservices, and ensuring code quality across the team. 
I also mentor developers, helping them follow best practices and optimize performance. I’m now looking for a new challenge where I can leverage both my hands-on technical experience and leadership skills to deliver high-quality solutions.

## 2. Describe your current role and responsibilities
In my current role, I lead a team of six developers, and we work on building healthcare applications that enhance patient care. 
I handle backend development in Python and Django, design REST APIs, and integrate multiple third-party systems. 
On the frontend, I contribute to building React-based dashboards for patient engagement. 
One of my key responsibilities is optimizing performance—like when we had slow data aggregation for reports, I implemented asynchronous processing using **Celery and Redis**, which reduced processing time from 10 minutes to under 1 minute. 
I also ensure the team follows coding standards, proper testing practices, and CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployments.

## 3. Describe a challenging project you worked on
One challenging project involved integrating multiple third-party healthcare systems for patient records. 
Each system had different authentication protocols and data formats, which made it complex to unify the data. 
I designed a **microservices architecture** where each integration was isolated, and I created adapter layers to normalize the data. 
We used secure token-based authentication for all APIs. 
This approach improved system reliability and reduced manual reconciliation work by around **80%**, while significantly improving patient data accuracy.

## 4. How do you ensure code quality and scalability?
I ensure code quality by implementing thorough code reviews, unit testing, and enforcing best practices across the team. 
For scalability, I design services to handle horizontal scaling, optimize database queries, and use caching with **Redis** where needed. 
For example, in a patient lookup API, I added composite indexes and caching, which cut response times by nearly 50%. 
I also use **CI/CD pipelines in AWS CodePipeline** to automate testing and deployment, ensuring that new code integrates smoothly without affecting existing functionality.

---

## 5. How do you handle deadlines or pressure?
When facing tight deadlines, I break down projects into smaller deliverables, prioritize critical tasks, and maintain clear communication with my team. 
For instance, during a critical release for a patient portal, we divided the integration work into three sprints, continuously monitored progress, and coordinated closely with QA. 
As a result, we were able to deliver the project on time without compromising quality.

---

## 6. Describe a time you resolved a team conflict
In one project, two developers disagreed on the API structure for a critical module. 
I organized a design discussion where we reviewed both approaches, weighing the pros and cons. 
By facilitating this discussion and focusing on the project’s goals rather than personal opinions, we reached a consensus. 
This not only resolved the conflict but also improved collaboration and decision-making within the team.

## 7. Explain your experience with AWS or cloud services
I have experience deploying microservices on AWS using ECS and EC2, storing files in S3, and using RDS for PostgreSQL databases. 
For example, I set up **CloudWatch** monitoring and alerts for our healthcare applications to ensure high availability and quick issue resolution. 
I’ve also worked with **Lambda** for asynchronous tasks and automated deployments using CI/CD pipelines, which reduced manual intervention and improved deployment reliability.

---

## 8. What validation tools did you use in your project?
In the backend, I use Django’s built-in validation tools to ensure data integrity. Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers handle most input validation, and I implement custom validators for domain-specific rules like validating patient IDs and date formats.  
On the frontend, I use **Formik and Yup** for real-time form validation, including conditional validation for optional fields.  
I also apply data sanitization and security checks to prevent SQL injection and ensure data consistency.  
This layered validation approach ensures clean, secure, and reliable data flow throughout the application.

## 9. Describe your current project (Major Project Overview)
At **Bon Secours Mercy Health**, I lead a team developing scalable healthcare applications aimed at improving patient engagement. 
The main focus is a patient portal and backend services for appointments, patient records, notifications, and third-party integrations.  
We use **Python, Django, Django REST Framework, React, PostgreSQL, Celery, and Redis** as our core tech stack.  
I designed a **microservices-based architecture** to handle multiple system integrations and ensure data consistency.  
One key achievement was reducing manual data reconciliation by 80% through automation and data normalization.  
I also manage CI/CD pipelines, perform code reviews, and ensure scalability, security, and performance in all deliverables.

---

## 10. What is the level of coding you do in your project?
The level of coding I do is quite advanced and production-grade. 
I develop RESTful APIs, complex backend logic, and integration layers for multiple external systems using Python and Django. 
I also work with asynchronous processing using Celery and Redis, and handle optimization at both code and database levels.  
On the frontend, I code React components for dashboards and forms, including real-time validation with Formik and Yup.  
My focus is on writing clean, modular, and reusable code, following design patterns and ensuring scalability and maintainability across the system.  
In short, the coding I do involves solving complex problems, integrating multiple systems, and ensuring the overall robustness of the product.
