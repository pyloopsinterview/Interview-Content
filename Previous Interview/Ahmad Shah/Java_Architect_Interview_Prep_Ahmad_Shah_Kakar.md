# Java Architect Interview Preparation - Ahmad Shah Kakar

This document contains common interview questions and detailed answers tailored for Ahmad Shah Kakar’s profile as a **Java Architect (Hibernate ORM)** in the **Financial Domain**.

---

## 1. Tell me about yourself
I’m Ahmad Shah Kakar, a Java Architect with over 14 years of experience designing and developing enterprise-grade financial systems. My expertise lies in Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate ORM, and microservice architecture. Currently, I’m working with PNC Bank on a Loan Origination and Processing System, where I focus on transaction management, data consistency, and secure system design using OAuth2 and JWT. I’ve also built CI/CD pipelines, containerized deployments with Kubernetes and AWS, and implemented event-driven, domain-driven architectures across multiple financial projects.

---

## 2. Tell me about your current project
At PNC Bank, I’m leading the architecture of a Loan Origination and Processing System (LOPS). It’s a high-volume, transaction-intensive platform that integrates with credit scoring, document verification, and payment gateways. My role involves defining the domain model, optimizing transaction boundaries, designing microservices, and deploying them to AWS using Docker and Kubernetes. I’ve implemented secure authentication mechanisms with OAuth2/JWT and established a full CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and SonarQube for continuous integration and quality checks.

---

## 3. What is Hibernate ORM?
Hibernate ORM is an Object-Relational Mapping framework that simplifies data persistence in Java applications by mapping Java objects to database tables. It eliminates the need for boilerplate JDBC code and provides advanced features like caching, lazy loading, and transaction management. In my experience, I’ve used Hibernate extensively to manage complex entity relationships and optimize database access in large-scale financial applications, ensuring both consistency and performance across millions of transactions.

---

## 4. What is Spring?
Spring is a powerful, lightweight framework used for building enterprise Java applications. It provides features for dependency injection, transaction management, and web application development. I’ve been using Spring to design modular, testable, and scalable systems. Its ecosystem—especially Spring Boot, Spring Data, and Spring Security—makes it ideal for microservice-based architectures in financial platforms where performance and security are critical.

---

## 5. What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a framework built on top of Spring that simplifies application setup and development by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features like metrics and health checks. I use it to rapidly build microservices that are easily deployable to cloud platforms like AWS. It streamlines deployment and minimizes configuration overhead, which is essential for delivering high-quality financial systems efficiently.

---

## 6. What is CI/CD pipeline?
A CI/CD pipeline automates the software delivery process—**Continuous Integration** ensures code is regularly merged and tested, while **Continuous Deployment/Delivery** automates the release process to production. In my projects, I’ve set up pipelines using Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus. Code gets built, tested, quality-checked, and deployed to AWS Kubernetes clusters automatically. This approach ensures faster delivery, consistency, and reliability in production releases.

---

## 7. What are Microservices Design Patterns?
Microservices design patterns are architectural strategies that solve common problems in distributed systems. Some key ones I’ve used include:
- **API Gateway** for routing and security.
- **Circuit Breaker** for fault tolerance.
- **Service Discovery** for dynamic service registration.
- **Saga Pattern** for distributed transactions.

These patterns ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability. For example, in our LOPS project, I implemented a Saga pattern to maintain data consistency across loan and payment services.

---

## 8. How have you used Microservices in your project?
In my current architecture, each core function—like loan origination, credit evaluation, and notifications—is a separate microservice communicating over REST APIs and Kafka. We used **Spring Boot** for service creation, **Spring Cloud** for configuration and discovery, and **Kubernetes (EKS)** for orchestration. This design allows independent scaling, resilience, and simplified maintenance while ensuring secure inter-service communication.

---

## 9. How do you deploy applications using CI/CD?
We build Docker images for each microservice, push them to **AWS ECR**, and deploy using **Kubernetes (EKS)** via Jenkins pipelines. The process includes steps for code checkout, build, unit testing, quality scanning, Dockerization, and deployment using Helm charts. I also integrated environment-based configuration management using ConfigMaps and Secrets for secure credentials.

---

## 10. How do you deploy in Kubernetes?
I typically package microservices as Docker images, define deployment manifests or Helm charts, and deploy them to Kubernetes clusters (EKS). The deployment files define replicas, environment variables, secrets, and services. Kubernetes handles scaling, load balancing, and self-healing automatically. I’ve also used AWS tools like ECR, CloudWatch, and IAM roles for secure and monitored deployments.

---

## 11. Explain OOPs Concepts
OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) principles—**Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**—form the foundation of my software design approach. They help build modular, reusable, and maintainable code. I apply these principles daily when defining domain models, designing APIs, and implementing architectural patterns across microservices.

---

## 12. What is Encapsulation? (Example)
Encapsulation means bundling data and related behavior into a single unit (a class) and restricting direct access using access modifiers. For example:

```java
public class Account {
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }
}
```
Here, the `balance` is hidden, and only controlled access is provided through methods. This ensures data integrity and security.

---

## 13. What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows one interface to represent multiple forms. In Java, it’s achieved via method overriding and overloading. For example, in my financial systems, I might have a `PaymentService` interface with different implementations for CreditCard, PayPal, or BankTransfer payments. The calling code interacts with the interface without worrying about the specific implementation, improving flexibility and extensibility.

---

## 14. What is Multiple Inheritance in Java?
Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance through classes to avoid ambiguity, but it supports multiple inheritance through **interfaces**. For example:

```java
interface LoanService { void approveLoan(); }
interface NotificationService { void sendNotification(String msg); }

class LoanProcessor implements LoanService, NotificationService {
    public void approveLoan() { System.out.println("Loan approved."); }
    public void sendNotification(String msg) { System.out.println("Notification: " + msg); }
}
```
This allows a class to combine multiple behaviors cleanly without conflict.

---

## 15. What is Singleton Pattern?
The Singleton pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists in the application and provides a global point of access. I often use it for managing configurations or logging.

```java
public class ConfigManager {
    private static ConfigManager instance;
    private ConfigManager() {}

    public static synchronized ConfigManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) instance = new ConfigManager();
        return instance;
    }
}
```
In production, I use thread-safe or enum-based Singletons to avoid concurrency issues.

---

## 16. Can Java implement multiple inheritance?
Java cannot implement multiple inheritance through classes because it leads to ambiguity, but it supports it through interfaces. This ensures clean separation of concerns and promotes modular design without conflicts between parent classes.
